# repo-template

A collection of files any git repository may have/need.

I wanted to make a handful of tools to automatically initialise a new project
for me, with minimal user input. Thus, this repository was born; it holds things
like license templates that said tools will use.

## License templates

There are several placeholders used in the license templates:

- `{{YEAR}}`, for... well... the current year
- `{{NAME}}`, for the name of the copyright holder
- `{{EMAIL}}`, for the email of the copyright holder

Also, note that license files are full lowercase, e.g. `mit.txt` instead of
`MIT.txt`.

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to
discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
